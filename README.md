# Sticky Notes App

My first Django project - A simple **sticky notes application** that allows users to **create, view, update, and delete** notes, in fulfilment of Module 2 Task 12 of the Stellenbosch University Software and Data Engineering Bootcamp.

## Features
- View a list of all created notes.
- Add new notes using a form.
- Edit existing notes.
- Delete notes.
- Uses Django's ORM for database interactions.
- Follows MVC architecture (`Models`, `Views`, and `Forms`).
